# node-express-weatherApp

Simple weather app with ability to check the current weather and a five-day weather forecast.

Install running npm install and start the app by running npm start. Visit localhost:3000 in your browser. You need to get your own API key from https://openweathermap.org/api and insert that into the code in two places: in postCurrentWeather and postForecast.

Tests can be run by typing npm test.
